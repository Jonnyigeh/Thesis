\chapter{Results}
In this chapter, we present parameter-optimization and dynamical-simulation results that test our implementation of the Morse double-well. We have two main goals: first, to identify the optimal parameters for the Morse double-well configuration $C_I$ and $C_{II}$ with the desired enrgy and entanglement properties and, second, driving the system adiabatically from configuation $C_I$ to configuration $C_{II}$ and back to implement an iSWAP-like two-qubit operation. After a brief introduction to the optimization and simulation methods, we divide our results into three sections: the static optimization of the potential paramteres (Section \ref{sec:static_optimization}), analysis of the reduced basis, entanglement measures and state populations (Section \ref{sec:reduced_basis}), and the time-dependent simulation of the iSWAP-like operation, investigating state and energy evolution under the ramp protocol (Section \ref{sec:time_dependent_simulation}), and a preliminary assessment of gate fidelity.\textcolor{red}{TODO: Should refeence to section on gate fidelity, also do we add a short summary of what results are being presented in each section?}
