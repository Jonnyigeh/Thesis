\section{Quantum Control and Quantum Logic}
Quantum computing is a rapidly developing field that promises to revolutionize information processing across disciplines such as cryptography, optimization, and materials science. While the subject has recently gained popular attention — even being mentioned in political discourse such as the 2024 U.S. presidential debates [source needed] — the practical realization of quantum computers still faces several significant challenges. At the top among these are the development of robust quantum hardware and the precise control of quantum systems, both of which fall under the umbrella of \emph{quantum control}. \\ \\
In this work, we study a simple double-well Morse potential — a possible prototype for a quantum dot system — and investigate its time-evolution under the influence of Coulomb interaction. By tuning the parameters that define the potential, we perturb the system and observe how its dynamics evolve. This controlled perturbation forms the basis for implementing quantum control strategies.

% QUANTUM CONTROL
\subsection{Quantum Control}
Quantum control refers to the ability to manipulate the state of a quantum system in a precise and predictable way. It is a foundational requirement for quantum computing, where qubits (quantum bits) must be steered through specific trajectories in their Hilbert space to perform logic operations. Just as classical computation depends on switching transistors (bits) on and off, quantum computation depends on the coherent manipulation of qubits via unitary transformations.\textcolor{red}{[source needed]} \\ \\In this context, our double well Morse potential serves as a minimal platform to demonstrate basic quantum control principles. By applying external fields or, as we shall see in this work, by tuning the parameters of the potential we can prepare our system for single-qubit operations, and induce transitions between different quantum states to perform two-qubit operations. This paves the way for considering Morse-type potentials candidates for robust and tunable qubit architectures - an avenue that, to our knowledge, has yet to be extensively explored in the literature. \\ \\ 

Achieving reliable single-qubit operations in our system requires energy levels to be well-separated and non-degenerate. This is crucial so that one can apply external fields to induce transitions in a single qubit without inducing unwanted transitions in the other qubit. With the 4 tunable parameters in our double well Morse potential\ref{eq:double_well_morse_potential}, we can achieve this by finding such a configuration that dinstinguishes the lowest lying single particle energy levels. The single particle energies are the Hartree energies of the two subsystems, found through the bipartite hartree calculation\ref{sec:bipartite_hartree}. In our work, this shall be referenced as the \emph{measurement configuration}, or \emph{configuration I}. It is in this configuration we want to make measurements of the system. 
\\ \\
The second configuration, \emph{configuration II}, we will study, we want to induce a transition between the two lowest lying single particle states. This configuration aims to make the first excited states of both subsystems degenerate, while maintaining separation among higher levels. In this configuration, we expect the respective energy eigenstates to mix, and this will entangle our two qubits - which in turn, allows for two-qubit operations such as the iSwap gate, or the CNOT gate to mention a few\textcolor{red}{sourcessss}.
\subsection{Quantum Logic}
 \\ \\
In our model, we aim to emulate the Swap and iSwap gate approximatively through Swap-like behaviour by dynamically tuning the system into configuration II as previously described. The iSwap gate is a two-qubit gate that swaps the states of two qubits while introducing a phase factor. It is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    \text{iSwap} = \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & i & 0 \\
    0 & i & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix} \
\end{equation}
where the Swap gate is similarly defined, without introducing the phase factor, as:
\begin{equation}
    \text{Swap} = \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix} \
\end{equation}
The iSwap gate is particularly useful in quantum algorithms that require entanglement between qubits, as it can create entangled states from separable ones. The phase factor introduced by the iSwap gate can also be used to implement quantum error correction codes, which are essential for fault-tolerant quantum computation.\textcolor{red}{sourcesss} \\ \\
\textcolor{red}{From here on, we need to be careful this is wrtiten purely by GPT, must be rewritten somewhat.}
In our system, configuration II is designed to bring the first excited states of the two subsystems into resonance. Under this near-degenerate condition, the Coulomb interaction mediates a coherent exchange of population between the qubit states. Although we do not explicitly model the full unitary dynamics or the phase evolution needed to realize the exact iSwap matrix, the behavior of our system mimics the essential ingredients of an iSwap-like gate: resonant exchange and entanglement generation.\\\\

By controlling the duration for which the system remains in configuration II, and by monitoring the population oscillations between the qubits, we can identify time windows where the system approximates the desired state-swapping behavior. This is analogous to how iSwap or √iSwap gates are implemented in superconducting or trapped-ion systems through Hamiltonian engineering and pulse timing.\textcolor{red}{sourcesss} \\ \\

Thus, our model represents a first step toward demonstrating quantum logic operations using Morse-type double well potentials. The anharmonicity of the Morse potential allows us to isolate low-lying states and avoid higher-level leakage, which is essential for the construction of robust, tunable qubit architectures. Future work could extend this model to include pulse-driven transitions and phase control to implement more general two-qubit gates.
