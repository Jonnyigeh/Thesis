\section{Optimization of the Morse Double-Well Parameters}\label{sec:optimization_result}
Applying the optimization procedure outlined in Section \ref{sec:optimization_procedure}, we identify two sets of optimal parameters for the Morse doubl well potential that meet the desired energy and entanglement criteria. Configuration $C_I$ is tailored to yield distinct, well-separated single-particle energy spectrums and vanishing two-body entanglement, while configuration $C_{II}$ is designed to produce a significant two-body entanglement and enforce a degeneracy of the first excited single-particle energy levels in each well to enable coherent mixing of the $\ket{10}$ and $\ket{01}$ logical states.
\\ 

Table \ref{tab:optimized_params} summarizes the five optimized parameters - depths of the left and right wells $D_L$ and $D_R$, widths $k_L$ and $k_R$, and inter-well separation $d$ -  for each configuation, all in atomic units (a.u.). In $C_I$ a deeper left well ($D_L = 73.4060$ a.u.) alongside a shallower right well ($D_R = 71.1004$ a.u.) ensures disctint eigenenergies and a von Neumann entanglement entropy of $S_{VN} = 0.0000$\textcolor{red}{TODO: Calculate, and insert} between the two first excited logical states $\ket{10}$ and $\ket{01}$, confirming a product state regime. Configuation $C_{II}$, on the other hand, slightly increases the right-well depth ($D_R = 71.9918$ a.u.) and adjust a more balanced width for both wells ($k_L = 29.1615$ a.u., $k_R = 29.1677$ a.u.) so that the first excited single-particle energies coincid within numerical tolerance, and we have degeneracy in our two-particle system.

This engineered degeneracy creates a sharp 'entanglement peak' in the potential parameter space, allowing our ramp protocol to traverse from $C_I$ to $C_{II}$ to induce mixing of the logical states $\ket{10}$ and $\ket{01}$, and thus, generate a significant two-body entanglement. The two configuations are similar within a few atomic units, so quantum control protocols can perturb our system without having to significantly alter the systme architecture, with minimal control overhead. \\

These two parameter configuations form the foundation for all subsequent static analyses and dynamical simulations in the thesis work.
