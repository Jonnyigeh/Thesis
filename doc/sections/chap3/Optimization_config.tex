\section{Optimization of the Morse Double-Well Parameters}\label{sec:optimization_result}
Applying the optimization procedure outlined in Section \ref{sec:optimization_procedure}, we identify two sets of optimal parameters for the Morse doubl well potential that meet the desired energy and entanglement criteria. Configuration $C_I$ is tailored to yield distinct, well-separated single-particle energy spectrums and vanishing two-body entanglement, while configuration $C_{II}$ is designed to produce a significant two-body entanglement and enforce a degeneracy of the first excited single-particle energy levels in each well to enable coherent mixing of the $\ket{10}$ and $\ket{01}$ logical states.
\\ 

Table \ref{tab:optimized_params} summarizes the five optimized parameters - depths of the left and right wells $D_L$ and $D_R$, widths $k_L$ and $k_R$, and inter-well separation $d$ -  for each configuation, all in atomic units (a.u.). In $C_I$ a deeper left well ($D_L = 62.1709$ a.u.) alongside a shallower right well ($D_R = 60.7336$ a.u.) ensures disctint eigenenergies and a von Neumann entanglement entropy of $S_{VN} = 0.0000$ across the first 6 energy eigenstates, indicating a product state regime. Configuation $C_{II}$, on the other hand, slightly increases the right-well depth ($D_R = 64.1174$ a.u.) and adjust a more balanced width for both wells ($k_L = 13.2271$ a.u., $k_R = 13.0978$ a.u.) so that the first excited single-particle energies coincid within numerical tolerance, and we have degeneracy in our two-particle system.

This engineered degeneracy creates a sharp 'entanglement peak' in the potential parameter space, allowing our ramp protocol to traverse from $C_I$ to $C_{II}$ to induce mixing of the logical states $\ket{10}$ and $\ket{01}$, and thus, generate a significant two-body entanglement. The two configuations are similar within a few atomic units, so quantum control protocols can perturb our system without having to significantly alter the system architecture, with minimal control overhead.

The plot shows the von Neumann entanglement entropy $S_{VN}$ in the first four eigenstates of the system, as a function of sweeping parameter $\lamda(t)$. The inset highlights the sharpness of the peak, indicating a narrow range of parameters where the first excited states are nearly degenerate, allowing for significant two-body entanglement generation. The peak is centered around $\lambda = 1$, corresponding to configuration $C_{II}$, where the first excited states are entangled. Parameters for configuration $C_I$ and $C_{II}$ are listed in Table \ref{tab:optimized_params}}.

Figure \ref{fig:entanglement_peak} illustrates the sharpness of the entanglement peak in the parameter space of our optimization procedure. The plot shows the von Neumann entanglement entropy $S_{VN}$ in the first four eigenstates of the system, as a function of sweeping parameter $\lamda(t)$ as we traverse from configuration $C_I$ at $\lambda = 0$, to configuration $C_{II}$ at $\lambda = 1.0$ and beyond. The inset highlights the sharpness of the peak where we have 'good' parameters that allow for significant two-body entanglement generation. This further illustrates the difficulty of optimizing said parameters, as the parameter space is barren and mostly flat (it looks more flat in the figure due to the sweep being linear, as seen in \eqref{eq:interpolation_function}), and why a good initial guess was crucial for the optimization procedure to converge to the desired configuration.

  \caption{Energy curves for the four lowest lying energy eigenstates of the Morse potential as a function of ramping parameter $\lambda(t)$. The curves illustrate the avoided crossing between the first excited states in configuration $C_{II}$, where the first excited states $\ket{10}$ and $\ket{01}$ are nearly degenerate, and repel each other. The inset highlights the avoided crossing, where the non-interacting energies would cross and 'swap' places, but due to the Coulomb interaction the states repel each other, creating a 'gap' in the energy spectrum. Because our numerical procedure only enforces near-degeneracy, we omit overlaying the non-interacting energies to avoid confusion, as they are shifted in the spectrum due to the degeneracy not being exact. }

\end{figure}
In the inset of figure \ref{energy_curves_avoided_crossing} we show the avoided crossing of the first excited energy levels as we move into the (near)-degenerate configuration $C_{II}$. The energy curves are plotted as a function on ramping paramter $\lambda(t)$, which varies from $0$ to $1$ as we ramp from configuration $C_I$ to $C_{II}$. The first excited states $\ket{10}$ and $\ket{01}$ are nearly degenerate, and repel each other due to the Coulomb interaction, creating a 'gap' in the energy spectrum where the non-interacting energies would cross and 'swap' places. This is akin to the avoided crossing we visualized in the Landau-Zener model in Section \ref{sec:avoided_crossings}. We originally intended to overlay the corresponding non-interacting energies (that would cross in the absence of coupling), but in practice they do not cross exactly at $\lambda = 1.0$ as our numerical procedure only enforces near-degeneracy up to finite tolerance. To avoid confusion by introducing a non-interacting energy that does not cross exactly at the same point, we omitted the non-interacting curves. We simply note that, in an ideal scenario, the uncoupled energies would indeed cross at $\lambda = 1.0$, and the avoided crossing would be exact when coupling is introduced. In our case however, the near-degeneracy is more than sufficient to inducee the desired mixing of the logical states $\ket{10}$ and $\ket{01}$, and thus, generate significant two-body entanglement.

These two parameter configuations form the foundation for all subsequent static analyses and dynamical simulations in the thesis work when working in the $l=4$ regime. \textcolor{red}{TODO: in the 2 level system we have separate parameters. Should we add these also here? Or make separate sections? Could give smoe useful insights how the parameters must chang when higher order terms are included. ALSO: Add a discussion on the implications of these parameters for the physical realization of the system, and how they relate to experimental setups. What does this mean for the distance between the particles, and how does this affect the entanglement generation? Are we within working ranges of experimental setups? Other physical properties and constraints that might be relevant at this distance?}

Figure \ref{fig:populations_I} show the computational basis state (Hartree states) occupancy of the six lowest two-particle energy eigenstates in the Sinc-DVR product basis for configuration $C_I$, where we observe that the states are indeed pure product states within a numerical tolerance of $10^{-7}$. Each eigenstate has exactly one dominant block, and is zero elsewhere - meaning the there is vanishing two-body entanglement between the particles, as seen from the listed entropy $S$ for each state - just what we aimed to achieve for the separable configuration.

  \label{fig:populations_II}
  \caption{State populations of the six lowest two-particle energy eigenstates in configuration $C_{II}$. The first excited states $\ket{10}$ and $\ket{01}$ are now mixed, with significant contributions from the first excited state in each well. The entropy $S$ for these states is equal to 1 (within a tolerance of $10^-6$), indicating (near) maximal entanglement. We note that maximal entanglement is not equivalent to being in a Bell state, but rather, maximally entangled with \emph{multiple} states beyond $\ket{01}, \ket{10}$. In this mixed configuration however, we see traces of other basis states leaking into our previously pure product states, especially prevalent in the higher energy states.This is seen as transparent red/blue tint in the heatmap, indicating minor contributions from other basis states.}
\end{figure}

By contrast, Figure \ref{fig:populations_II} illustrates the same six two-particle energy eigenstates under configuation $C_{II}$, where we observe that the first excited states $\ket{10}$ and $\ket{01}$ are now mixed, with both states having significant contributions from both wells. The mixture is almost equal, and we are close to achieve the Bell states (maximally entangled states) for these two energy eigenstates, as indicated by the entropy $S \approx 1$. This means we have near perfect superpositions of the logical states $\ket{10}$ and $\ket{01}$. The remaining states remain essentially pure product states up to numerical tolerance ($10^{-7}$), highlighting that only the desired qubit subspace is affected by the entanglement, while the rest of the two-particle Hilbert space remains unaffected. This will be crucial for quantum control protocols we aim to run.
\\

Together, these two static heatmaps validate our optimization procedure: Configuration $C_I$ produces well-separated, unentangled energy eigenstates, while configuration $C_{II}$ enforces a degeneracy of the first excited states, enabling a coherent mixing of the logical states $\ket{10}$ and $\ket{01}$, thus generating significant two-body entanglement needed for our two-qubit gate operation protocols. The optimized parameters for both configurations are used in all subsequent analyses and simulations throughout the thesis, ensuring a consistent and controlled environment for our investigations into quantum control and entanglement dynamics in the Morse double-well potential. \textcolor{red}{TODO: More discussion needed. Highlight that there is non-zero entanglement for the higher order states, as seen in the heatmap, but this is not a problem as the entanglement entropy is $< 10^{-5}$, and thus negligible. }
